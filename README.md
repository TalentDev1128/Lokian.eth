This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Steps for deployment and use of our Cryptomons App.

-First deploy our smart contract found in src/cryptomons.sol.

-In the main file of our user interface src/App.js specify the address where you deployed the contract in the constant CONTRACT_ADDRESS.

-In the project directory run:

### `npm install`

This installs all the necessary dependencies to build our application

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

-If you use the metamask extension in the browser that you opened the User Interface with "npm start" you can see all the Cryptomons owned by your account and play the game.
